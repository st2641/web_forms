# web_forms
created repo for registration forms

//ReunionReg2015
This repo was created to store any forms that I need to create for projects accepting inputs and neeeding to process those inputs. The output of the application is to push out email notifications to both the registrant and registrar.

The form will check that the required inputs have been inserted into the field and/or checkbox.
Once the form is vaidated, the inputs will be processed onto a confirmation page for the user to accept or return to the registration form.
Once the form is accepted, it will be emailed out to the Administrator.
